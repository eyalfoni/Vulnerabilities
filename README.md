# Web vulnerabilities #

## This project explores web vulnerabilities with a hands-on approach ##

### Background ###

This project is a means to learn common web vulnerabilities by understanding how
bugs are introduced into code, the ways to exploit these bugs, and how
to write secure code.

Each directory covers a different topic and has information about related
technologies necessary to understand the vulnerability. For example,
background in SQL/database are needed to understand [SQL Injections](https://github.com/eyalfoni/Vulnerabilities/tree/master/SQL_Injection).

Instructions and explanations will be given for each topic in order to exploit
the vulnerability first-hand.
